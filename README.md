# Portfolio

## About
This is my future website. It's meant to be a place where I give an overview of projects I created or contributed to, personal and contact information and maybe a blog for things I learn here and there.
It's created with React with TypeScript and SCSS using webpack.

Here's a sneak peek, but since I'm refactoring it (hopefully for the last time) this will change completely.

## Notes
With the last refactor I'm trying to turn this into a really flexible design sandbox that can double as a working website.
There's a .art file that I use for random sketches as I'm developing. It always ends up being a mess but might be fun to look at. You can open it with [Mischief](https://www.madewithmischief.com/).

## Running
It's not online yet, but it's NodeJS, so you should be able to just clone it and run `npm install`, `npm start`. If all goes well it will be served on localhost:8080.
The vscode debugger is also configured to work with Chrome (it's the only available configuration).
